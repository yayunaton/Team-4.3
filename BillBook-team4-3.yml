  BillBook is a database for accounting management. It records transactions 
  between group members and between a most-simplified debt relationship 
  between members such that the time of transaction is minimized. 
  For example, a group of people traveling together can note down payments 
  such as booking a hotel, ordering a meal, and buying tickets in the system. 
  The database stores these data and records transactions owed to one another. 
  At the end of the activities, a group member can check his ownership to 
  other members based on the data.
